Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # null_resource.next will be created
  + resource "null_resource" "next" {
      + id = (known after apply)
    }

  # null_resource.previous will be created
  + resource "null_resource" "previous" {
      + id = (known after apply)
    }

  # time_sleep.wait_30_seconds will be created
  + resource "time_sleep" "wait_30_seconds" {
      + create_duration = "75s"
      + id              = (known after apply)
    }
